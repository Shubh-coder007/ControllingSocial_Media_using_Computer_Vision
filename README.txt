Mainly in this project I have used OpenCV, Numpy and Pyautogui.
Basically here in this project I have used yellow color but you can use any other color by changing the values in numpy array.
It will detect only those object whose area is more than 400, so that small moving objects don't get detected.
Here after running Main.py file you have to open any of your social media or any other website you want to scroll.
After it detects yellow color object(color can be changed), if you move that object downwards then you would be able to see that the website you opened started to scroll on it's own, it is done using pyautogui.

If you think to make any kind of updates then after updating do pull request to me so that even I can learn from it and it to main file too!
